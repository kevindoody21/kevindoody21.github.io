  <p>I was raised in Canton, Massachusetts, or as I like to call it, "God's Country". It is a small suburb 15 minutes from Boston. My father, Charlie, is the Fire Chief in Canton, while my mother, Lisa, is an X-Ray technician. I have two other siblings, Michael and Kathryn. Michael is 21 years old, and currently in Paramedic School studying to be a full time Paramedic, and eventually a Fire Fighter like my father. My sister, Kathryn, is a senior at Canton High School, and will be attending our rival, UNH, this coming fall.</p>
  
  <h2>Fun Family Facts</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Michael- Played baseball until he was a freshman in high school. After making the freshman baseball team, he had a change of heart, and decided to pick up a lacrosse stick. By his senior year, he was named Captain and received an athletic scholarship to play at Assumption College.</li>
  <li>Kathryn- Plays varsity soccer, hockey, and field hockey. She also received several DIII offers to be goalie for both soccer and field hockey, but has opted to be a full time student at UNH.</li>
  <li>Lisa (Mom)- Met my father in high school, remained together through college after they both decided to go to different schools. She received an athletic scholarship to play field hockey at UNH, where my father was attending, and decided to go to Assumption College instead as a full time student. </li>
  <li>Charlie (Dad)- Introduced the game of baseball to me. His father, Bucky, was a fire fighter in Canton his entire life. When my dad joined the department at the young age of 24, he was able to be on the same squad as his father.</li>
  </ol>

  
  <p>My family has been, and continues to be, a huge staple in my life. </p>
